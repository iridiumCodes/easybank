## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS / BEM
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Light JavaScript


### Useful resources

- [BEM Methodology](http://getbem.com/introduction/) - This helped me organize my css in an intuitive and maintainable way. I really liked this methodology and will use it going forward.
- [FLEX Cheatsheet](https://flexbox.malven.co/) , [GRID Cheatsheet](https://grid.malven.co/) - These two are amazing visual guides to CSS Flexbox and Grid, which helped me finally internalize their different uses and potential. I'd recommend them to anyone still learning these concepts.
